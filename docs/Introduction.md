## shasta-forms

`shasta-forms` provides a wrapper around [redux-form](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form) with a few nice features:
- Write jsx form fields with attributes, no outside metadata
- Validation via [redux-form-schema](https://github.com/Lighthouse-io/redux-form-schema)
- Automatic error reporting
- Works with shasta/immutable.js out of the box

## Install

`npm install shasta-forms`
